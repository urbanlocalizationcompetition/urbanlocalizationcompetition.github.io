												<p>SIn wireless communications, the pathloss (or large scale fading coefficient) quantifies the loss
of signal strength between a transmitter (Tx) and a receiver (Rx) due to large scale effects, such as
free-space propagation loss, and interactions of the radio waves with the obstacles (which block
line-of-sight, like buildings, vehicles, pedestrians), e.g. penetrations, reflections and diffractions.
Many present or envisioned applications in wireless communications explicitly rely on the
knowledge of the pathloss function, and thus, estimating pathloss is a crucial task. Some
example use cases include: User-cell site association, fingerprint-based localization, physical-
layer security, optimal power control, path planning, and activity detection.
Deterministic simulation methods such as ray-tracing are well-known to provide very good
estimations of pathloss values. However, their high computational complexity renders them
unsuitable for most of the envisioned applications.
In the very recent years, many research groups have developed deep learning-based methods
which achieve a comparable accuracy with respect to ray-tracing, but with orders of magnitude
lower computational times, making accurate pathloss estimations available for the applications.
In order to foster research and facilitate fair comparisons among the methods, we provide a
novel pathloss radio map dataset based on ray-tracing simulations and launch the First Pathloss
Radio Map Prediction Challenge.
In addition to the pathloss prediction task, the challenge also includes coverage classification
as a second independent task, where the locations in a city map should be classified to be above
or below a given pathloss value.
Support on the dataset and the instructions will be provided by the organizing team.</p>

<!--											<h3>Call for Participation</h3>-->
											<p>In urban environments, Global Navigation Satellite Systems fail to provide good accuracy because of the low 
												likelihood of line-of-sight (LOS) links between the User Equipment (UE) to be located and the satellites, due 
												to the presence the buildings that block the satellite signals. Thus, other approaches, that can reliably 
												operate under non-line-of-sight (NLOS) conditions are required. 
                                            </p>
                                            <p>
 In the recent years, many researchers have developed algorithms that are tailored to perform under heavy NLOS conditions. Many of such methods use Received Signal Strength (RSS) 
						    or Time of Arrival (ToA) (or both, in hybrid methods) information regarding the beacon signals that are regularly sent from wireless 
						    anchor infrastructure nodes such as Base Stations (BS) or Access Points (AP).  
                                                </p>
                                            <p>
In order to foster research and facilitate fair comparisons among the methods in realistic NLOS heavy conditions, we provide a  pathloss radio map dataset based on accurate 
						    radio wave propagation simulations along with the corresponding novel ToA radio map dataset generated under realistic urban scenarios and launch 
						    the <b><em>Urban Wireless Localization Competition.</em></b>
                                                </p>
                                            <p>
The main task of the competition is to develop highly accurate localization methods which can make use of RSS (pathloss) and ToA measurements. 
                                                </p>
						  <p>					
											The ranking of the methods is going to be based on the average of their accuracies in NLOS-only and NLOS/LOS-mixed scenarios and under different noise levels on the RSS and 
											ToA measurements.
                                                </p>
                                            
						<p>
                                            The top 3 ranked teams will be invited to submit a (maximum) 6-page paper and present it at MLSP 2023. The accepted papers will be published in the MLSP proceedings.</p>
                                            <p>
                                            The deadline for the submission of the results (location estimates in the test set), trained models (if applicable), and the test codes is July 12, 2023. 
                                            </p>

                                            <h3>Main Task: Location Estimation using RSS/ToA</h3>
											<p>The main task of the challenge is to achieve accurate location estimates by using either or both the pathloss and ToA radio maps. 
												</p><p>The participants are asked to develop methods that are robust to realistic inaccuracies in their radio map estimates. 
												To this end, we  model the mismatch between the  available and real RSS and ToA information by additive Gaussian noise terms. 
                                            </p><p>
											The ranking of the submitted methods will be based on the average of their accuracies in NLOS-only and NLOS/LOS-mixed scenarios and under
											different noise levels on the RSS and ToA measurements (the exact values of the noise variances to be  
											decided).</p>
                                            <h3>Optional Tasks: RSS- or ToA-only localization</h3>
											<p>The participants are encouraged to also submit methods that only use the RSS or 
												ToA information.
